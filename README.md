![Recell Image](/images/used-cell-phones-111821.jpeg)

**ReCell Project**  

During the Supervised Learning - Post Graduate Programme Course, I undertook the ReCell Project, leveraging my Python skills to analyze a dataset of used devices. In this project, I employed Linear Regression to construct a dynamic pricing model for used and refurbished devices. Ensuring a robust understanding, I evaluated and addressed the assumptions of Linear Regression to enhance the model's reliability. The analysis identified crucial factors influencing device prices. The project showcased my proficiency in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and provided valuable business insights and recommendations based on the model's findings.

**E-news Express Project**

During the PGP, I led the E-news Express Project, employing statistical analysis, A/B testing, and visualization techniques to assess the efficacy of the new landing page for an online news portal. Utilizing a simulated dataset, I analyzed critical metrics like converted status and time spent on the page, ultimately determining the landing page's effectiveness. The project also delved into statistical inference to explore the impact of preferred language on conversion rates.

**FoodHub Order Analysis**

As part of the PGP Course, I undertook the FoodHub Order Analysis Project, focusing on the exploration of orders data from a food aggregator company. Through thorough exploratory data analysis, including Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, and Bi-Variate analysis, I addressed key questions posed by the Data Science team. The project aimed to extract actionable insights to enhance the business strategies of the company. Python was the primary language used for this comprehensive data analysis.

**INN Hotel Analysis**

In the "INN Hotels" project, we utilized supervised learning and classification as the primary tools for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the data. The primary objective was to construct a predictive model capable of preemptively identifying bookings likely to be canceled, thus facilitating the formulation of effective policies for cancellations and refunds. This project 

Key Highlights:

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and patterns.
- Implemented Data Preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Utilized Logistic Regression to model the likelihood of booking cancellations.
- Addressed Multicollinearity issues to ensure the robustness of the predictive model.
- Evaluated model performance using the Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve.
- Employed Decision Tree algorithms and Pruning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability.

By leveraging these skills and tools, I successfully developed a predictive model that offers insights into booking cancellation patterns, thereby empowering INN Hotels to optimize their policies and mitigate revenue loss associated with cancellations.

![Easy visa Images](/images/easy-visa.jpeg)

**Easy Visa Project**

In the "EasyVisa" project, we focused on employing ensemble techniques to analyze data pertaining to Visa applicants. Our objective was to build a predictive model facilitating the visa approval process. Additionally, we aimed to recommend suitable applicant profiles for visa certification or denial based on factors significantly influencing visa status.

Key Highlights:

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and trends within the Visa applicant dataset.
- Implemented Data Preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Utilized Customer Profiling methods to identify distinct applicant profiles.
- Employed Bagging Classifiers such as Bagging and Random Forest, as well as Boosting Classifiers including AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
- Utilized a Stacking Classifier to enhance model performance through ensemble learning.
- Conducted Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
- Derived actionable Business Insights from the analysis to inform decision-making processes.

Through the application of these skills and tools, we developed a robust predictive model for streamlining the visa approval process and offering valuable recommendations for applicant profiles, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the EasyVisa system.


## Personal Projects

![Credit Card Default](/images/defaulting_card.jpeg)

**Credit Card Default**  

[Project](https://github.com/AhmedShehata2002/Personal_Projects.git)

Our project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning classification techniques to assess loan applicants' risk of default. Leveraging various data points like credit history and loan amount, we enhance model accuracy using numeric and categorical attributes. Through analyzing misclassification costs, we refine our strategy for reliable credit risk assessment. The conclusion and recommendations to the project were that post-pruning decision trees achieved the highest recall. Key features like credit history and checking balance greatly influence default prediction. We recommend adding essential columns like Debt-to-Income Ratio,Education Level, Geographic Location, Financial Assets, and Financial Reserves for comprehensive risk assessment.

![Oura Health Metrics](/images/oura_2.jpeg)

**Personal Health Ring** 

This is my next upcoming project in this project I will download over 5 months of my personal activity and sleep metrics to assess my performance based on my "readiness level", activity level and sleep. Other metrics will include body temperature, REM sleep, HRV, Steps, Equivalent Walking Distance and recovery index. This data will be used to assess how I could further improve my health and wellbeing as well as provide as overview of my physical performance over the last couple of months.
